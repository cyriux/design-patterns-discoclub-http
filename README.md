# Design Patterns Disco Club HTTP

Sample audio server to play music by playing with HTTP design patterns during our workshop.

This audio server exposes endpoints to:
- A **sampler** (sample player) that can play audio samples stored in the /app folder
- A GM **synthesizer** that can play the built-in GM sounds from the default soundbank
- A unique **director** that can provide guidance to other players: common tempo, main theme melody...
